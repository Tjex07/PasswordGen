The password generator was a project designed to test the ability of the fledgling coder. The password generator has a minimum of requirement of 8 characters and scales up to 64.  A password minimun and max is enforced to coincide with the NIST-800-53 publication released by the National Institue of Standards of Technology. With the password generator you are able to create a password including lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols.  A check box is adjacent to each option allowing you to customize the complexity of the password.
